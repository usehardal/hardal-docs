# API for Developers

Hardal allows you to pull data directly by calling the API endpoints.
The endpoints are available at `http://usehardal.com/api`.
All data is returned as JSON.

Any operation you can do thorugh the Hardal is available in the API, but it might not yet be documented.

## Authentication

### `POST /api/auth/login`

First you need to get a _token_ in order to make API requests. You need to make a
`POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the following data:

```json
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

If successful you should get a response like the following:

```json
{
  "token": "eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A"
}
```

Save the token value and send an `Authorization` header with all your data requests with the value `Bearer <token>`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```shell
curl https://yoursever/api/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Sending stats

### `POST /api/collect`

To register a `pageview` or `event`, you need to send a `POST` to `/api/collect` with
the following data:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        referrer: "",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080",
    },
    type: "pageview"
}
```

For events, from v1.37 onwards, you would send:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        event_name: "click-signup-button",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080"
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        event_type: "click",
        event_value: "signup-button", //or web3 value
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080"
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

Note, for `/api/collect` requests you do not need to send an
authentication token.

Also, you need to send a proper `User-Agent` HTTP header or
your request won't be registered.
