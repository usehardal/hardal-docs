# Creating Custom Events

This instruction guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on creating custom events using the `hardal.trackEvent()` function.

The guide covers everything from generating the **JavaScript** function and assigning a unique event code, to adding the event to your website and testing it. Whether you are a developer or non-technical user, this guide will help you get started with creating custom events to better track user interactions on your website.

## Add a new custom event

Each custom event requires a unique code, which will be passed as a string argument to the `hardal.trackEvent()` function. For example, if your event code is **GROMT9EB2**, the function would be: `hardal.trackEvent('GROMT9EB2')`.

To add the custom event to your website, you will need to insert the hardal.trackEvent() function in the relevant section of your website's code. This could be an onClick event on a button, or in response to some other user interaction.

To using the custom events you will need to send a JavaScript function using the format:

```JavaScript
hardal.trackEvent("EVENT_CODE");
```

## Setup your new custom event

- Name your new custom event.
- Use the code below to run your custom event on your app.

- Upon completing all necessary fields, click the **Save** button to create your website. Your newly created custom event will appear in your dashboard, ready for use.
